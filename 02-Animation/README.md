This is my second Three.js practice focused on animation and motion control.

## About
In this exercise, I learned how to manipulate object properties such as position, rotation, and distance, as well as how to make the camera look at specific points using lookAt().

I also implemented animations using requestAnimationFrame(), delta time stabilization with Date.now(), and arrow functions for cleaner logic flow.
This project helped me understand how to build logical and sequential animation processes in real time.

Here is the result of this exercise:
