# Three.js Practice 🎨✨

This repository contains my personal practice exercises for learning **Three.js**.  
Each folder represents a different exercise, starting from basic geometry to animations and lighting.

## 📂 Contents

| Folder      | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `01-cube` | Basic cube with camera and renderer 🟦 |
| `02-Animation` | Sequential cube animation with deltaTime and logic control 🎥 |
| `03-Camera` | Interactive camera control using cursor input, sin & cos math functions 📸 |
| `04-Fullscreen` | Responsive fullscreen mode with resize handling and pixel ratio limit 🖥️ |
| `05-Geometries` | Procedural geometry built from raw Float32Array vertex buffers ⬡ |

*(More exercises will be added over time! 🚀)*
