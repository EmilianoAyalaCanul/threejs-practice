## Orbit 🌌🪐
For this project, we will focus on recreating simple orbits.  

An **orbit** is the curved path of an object around a point in space, usually around a larger body due to gravitational forces. In our project, it represents the path that planets or other objects follow around a central point, like the Sun.
