# Theoretical Concepts 📚✨

## Orbit 🌌🪐
For this project, we will focus on recreating simple orbits.  
An **orbit** is the curved path of an object around a point in space, usually around a larger body due to gravitational forces. In our project, it represents the path that planets or other objects follow around a central point, like the Sun.

## Sine Function 🌊📏

The **sine function (sin)** represents the vertical position of a point on a unit circle corresponding to a given angle.  

- The sine value is always **between -1 and 1**:  
  $|sin(x)| <= 1$
  This means the point never goes above 1 or below -1 on the vertical axis. ✅

- The sine function can also be approximated using the **Taylor series** around 0:  

$sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!}$

- In our project, the sine function helps calculate the **vertical position (z-axis)** of the orbiting point along a circular path. 🪐🔄
