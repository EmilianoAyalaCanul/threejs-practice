## About
In this exercise, I learned how to enable and manage fullscreen mode in a 3D scene using Three.js and JavaScript.

I used window.addEventListener() to detect resize events and dynamically update the renderer’s size based on window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight.
I also applied a pixel ratio limit of 2 using renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2)) to prevent excessive rendering and improve performance on high-resolution screens.

This project helped me understand how to make a 3D scene fully responsive and optimized, maintaining a consistent look across different screen sizes and devices.

Here is the result of this exercise:
